Part One:  Written questions  [25 points]
1.  When a long message gets encrypted with Substitution Cipher method, vowel characters, especially the English letter 'e' tends to appear significantly more frequent than other alphabets. Therefore, an adversary can assume that the character that appears the most in the cipher text is the English letter 'e'.
- can be broken by frequency analysis (look for frequencies of characters) and pattern analysis (double Qs could be double Ds, Es, Ls, etc.)

2. If use of a single one-time pad offers perfect secrecy, we can assume that an adversary doesn't know what this pad is. Therefore, although an adversary has a knowledge on the second pad and a cipher text, a plain text cannot be calculated. Since as its name indicates, one-time pad uses each pad once and if pad is randomly generated, it also guarantees the independence between different pads. Also, one-time pad offers a perfect secrecy.

3.  AES encryption algorithm in ECB mode. Is this a good choice? Give two reasons why or why not.
- No, because ECB uses a concept of Block Ciphers where blocks of plain text are individually encrypted and concatenated together. Therefore:
1) Identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks
2) encrypted blocks can be shuffled (out-of-order) without detection
- due to the above reasons, the messages sent between remote user and machine can be discovered by an adversary.
